 * poll.js — Quick "would you rather" and this-or-that poll generator.

 * Not a real poll with voting — generates a fun either/or question that

 * .wouldyourather       — random question
 * .wouldyourather nsfw  — (filtered out, same as clean)
 *
 * This is a lightweight fun command — for actual polls use .poll.
