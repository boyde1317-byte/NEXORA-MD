/**
 * owner.js — bot owner contact card.
 *
 * Sent via mixedCard (buttonsMessage) with a full button row
 * (call / chat / copy / quick_reply).
 *
 * Tier 1: mixedCard (buttonsMessage — call/url/copy/quick_reply buttons).
 * Tier 2: guaranteed styled asciiBuilder box (no bare plain text).
 *
 * carouselMessage was previously tried as Tier 1 here but was removed —
 * relayMessage resolves fine even when the recipient's client can't
 * render carouselMessage, so the try/catch fallback never actually
 * caught the real-world failure (users saw "your version of WhatsApp
 * doesn't support it").
 *
 * Owner number is intentionally hardcoded per product requirement — this is
 * a fixed contact card, not a per-deployment config value.
