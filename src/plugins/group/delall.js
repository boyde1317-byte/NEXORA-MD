/**
 * @file src/plugins/group/delall.js
 *
 * .delall — sweep every message the bot has recently sent in the
 * current chat (group or DM). Powered by src/lib/outgoingCache.js,
 * which transparently records every outgoing id (sendMessage returns
 * + relayMessage messageId, so rich cards and menus count too).
 *
 * Gates match .purge: group admins / owner. The cache is capped and
 * in-memory, so this is recent-message housekeeping — messages from
 * before the last restart aren't known. Deletes are paced (~180ms)
 * to avoid tripping server-side rate limits; sweep capped at 200.
